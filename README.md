# How to do a commit
Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b "username_feature"
```

## Do your stuff

```bash
git status
```
Check the stuff you changed

```bash
git add . #to add all changed files
```
```bash
git add filepath #to add specific files
```

Then put a commit message on the staged changes

```bash
git commit -m "Your message maybe things you added/changed"
```

```bash
git push origin "username_feature" #your branch
```
